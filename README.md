# Habla: Speaking-First Language Exchange

## Overview

Habla is a speaking-first language exchange product case study focused on improving retention and confidence in conversational language learning. Through user research, iterative prototyping, and usability testing, the project validated that psychological safety, clear skill matching, and visible progress are stronger retention drivers than feature breadth. The final design achieved an ~83% likelihood-to-return score and produced clear product tradeoff insights around simplification, guidance, and trust.

This repository documents the **product discovery, design decisions, prototypes, and user validation** behind Habla. It is **not** a production-ready or deployed application.

## Problem

Many language learners struggle to transition from solo learning to real conversation. Existing tools often suffer from:

* Unstructured or awkward conversations
* Social anxiety and fear of embarrassment
* Poor skill-level matching between users
* Little feedback on progress or improvement

These issues lead to low retention and inconsistent speaking practice.



## Competitive Landscape

We analyzed existing platforms to understand where they succeed and fall short:

* **Duolingo** — strong for vocabulary and habits, weak for real conversation
* **Tandem / HelloTalk** — supports conversation but lacks structure and safety
* **Discord language servers** — flexible but overwhelming and inconsistent

**Gap identified:** a lack of structured, psychologically safe environments for speaking-first practice.


## Product Strategy

Based on interviews and observation, we defined core **Jobs-To-Be-Done**:

* Find appropriate conversation partners quickly
* Feel safe and confident speaking
* See visible progress over time

Feature prioritization followed a **must / should / could** framework grounded in user research.


## My Role
* Led the project end-to-end, establishing the initial task breakdown and execution plan and allowing team members to self-select workstreams based on interest and strengths
* Set early project direction and scope, ensuring alignment between user research, design decisions, and course requirements
* Conducted and led four user interviews, synthesizing insights into clear product requirements and jobs-to-be-done
* Guided prioritization and iteration based on usability findings, balancing feature ambition with cognitive simplicity

## Design & Prototyping

The product was developed iteratively:

* **Understanding People** Starting out with user personas, journey maps,
  early ethnography and semi-structured interviews of 7 bilingual University students
* **Low-fidelity Sketches** to explore core interaction flows and basic easrly stage ideas
* **Heuristic Evaluation** using Nielsen’s principles
* **High-fidelity Interactive Prototype** refining usability, clarity, and feedback using v0 by vercel

Key product concepts included:

* Visible language skill levels
* Scheduled conversations with real people
* AI-assisted conversation support
* Progress tracking and lightweight gamification

## Product Evolution & Key Decisions

This project intentionally evolved based on user feedback rather than initial assumptions.

Early Assumptions (Initial Hypothesis):
* Users would prefer open-ended conversation discovery
* More features (filters, indicators, options) would improve confidence
* Gamification would drive repeat usage 
  
What User Research Validated:
* Skill-level matching was critical for psychological safety
* Users preferred structured entry points 
* Progress feedback mattered more than social features
  
Decisions Made:
* Simplified room discovery and reduced choice overload
* Elevated skill matching to a primary interaction constraint
* Reframed AI from a “feature” to a support tool for confidence-building
* Shifted focus from feature expansion to clarity and guidance

Key Outcomes:
* Achieved ~83% likelihood-to-return, indicating strong product value despite known usability gaps.
* Strong perceived value of the core concept
* Identified confusion points related to navigation, role clarity, and visual hierarchy


## Key Learnings

* Clarity and guidance outperform feature depth
* Emotional safety is a first-order product constraint in social learning tools
* User behavior often diverges from design intent without continuous validation



## Future Work

* Simplify primary flows and reduce cognitive load
* Expand progress feedback and cultural learning elements
* Conduct broader usability testing with more diverse users
