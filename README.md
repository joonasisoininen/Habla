# Habla

Habla is a speaking-first language exchange product concept focused on reducing friction, anxiety, and drop-off in conversational language practice. I worked on this project using a product-led approach, from discovery through validated design.

- Conducted user interviews and observation to identify key pain points: unstructured conversations, social anxiety, unclear skill matching, and weak progress feedback
- Analyzed existing platforms (Duolingo, Tandem, HelloTalk, Discord) to identify gaps between solo learning and real conversation
- Defined core jobs-to-be-done around partner matching, psychological safety, and visible improvement
- Owned end-to-end user flows (onboarding, room discovery, live sessions, feedback) and led iterative prototyping from low- to medium-fidelity
- Integrated product features such as visible skill levels, AI-assisted conversation support, and progress tracking
- Planned and ran usability testing; achieved ~83% likelihood-to-return, indicating strong perceived product value

Key takeaways: clarity beats feature depth, emotional safety drives retention, and continuous user feedback is critical to aligning design intent with real behavior.
