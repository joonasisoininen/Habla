# Habla: Speaking-First Language Exchange

## Overview

Habla is a **product and UX case study** developed as part of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course at the University of Victoria. The project explores how product design, behavioral psychology, and usability testing can be used to reduce friction, anxiety, and drop-off in conversational language practice.

This repository documents the **product discovery, design decisions, prototypes, and user validation** behind Habla. It is **not** a production-ready or deployed application.

## Problem

Many language learners struggle to transition from solo learning to real conversation. Existing tools often suffer from:

* Unstructured or awkward conversations
* Social anxiety and fear of embarrassment
* Poor skill-level matching between users
* Little feedback on progress or improvement

These issues lead to low retention and inconsistent speaking practice.



## Competitive Landscape

We analyzed existing platforms to understand where they succeed and fall short:

* **Duolingo** — strong for vocabulary and habits, weak for real conversation
* **Tandem / HelloTalk** — supports conversation but lacks structure and safety
* **Discord language servers** — flexible but overwhelming and inconsistent

**Gap identified:** a lack of structured, psychologically safe environments for speaking-first practice.


## Product Strategy

Based on interviews and observation, we defined core **Jobs-To-Be-Done**:

* Find appropriate conversation partners quickly
* Feel safe and confident speaking
* See visible progress over time

Feature prioritization followed a **must / should / could** framework grounded in user research.



## Design & Prototyping

The product was developed iteratively:

* **Understadning People** Starting out with user personas, journey maps,
  early ethnography and semi-structured interviews of 7 bilingual University students
* **Low-fidelity sketches** to explore core interaction flows and basic easrly stage ideas
* **Heuristic evaluation** using Nielsen’s principles
* **Medium-fidelity interactive prototype** refining usability, clarity, and feedback

Key product concepts included:

* Visible language skill levels
* Scheduled conversations with real people
* AI-assisted conversation support
* Progress tracking and lightweight gamification

## Product Evolution & Key Decisions

This project intentionally evolved based on user feedback rather than initial assumptions.

Early assumptions:
* Users would prefer open-ended conversation discovery
* More features (filters, indicators, options) would improve confidence
* Gamification alone would motivate continued use
  
What user research validated:
* Skill-level matching was critical for psychological safety
* Users preferred structure over freedom when starting conversations
* Progress visibility increased motivation and trust
  
What changed as a result:
* Simplified room discovery and reduced choice overload
* Made skill levels highly visible and central to the experience
* Reframed AI from a “feature” to a support tool for confidence-building
* Shifted focus from feature expansion to clarity and guidance


**Key outcomes:**

* ~83% average likelihood-to-return score
* Strong perceived value of the core concept
* Identified confusion points related to navigation, role clarity, and visual hierarchy


## Key Learnings

* Clarity and guidance outperform feature depth
* Emotional safety is a first-order product constraint in social learning tools
* User behavior often diverges from design intent without continuous validation



## Future Work

* Simplify primary flows and reduce cognitive load
* Expand progress feedback and cultural learning elements
* Conduct broader usability testing with more diverse users
