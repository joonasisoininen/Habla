# Habla — Speaking-First Language Exchange

## Overview

Habla is a **product and UX case study** developed as part of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course at the University of Victoria. The project explores how product design, behavioral psychology, and usability testing can be used to reduce friction, anxiety, and drop-off in conversational language practice.

This repository documents the **product discovery, design decisions, prototypes, and user validation** behind Habla. It is **not** a production-ready or deployed application.

## Problem

Many language learners struggle to transition from solo learning to real conversation. Existing tools often suffer from:

* Unstructured or awkward conversations
* Social anxiety and fear of embarrassment
* Poor skill-level matching between users
* Little feedback on progress or improvement

These issues lead to low retention and inconsistent speaking practice.

---

## Competitive Landscape

We analyzed existing platforms to understand where they succeed and fall short:

* **Duolingo** — strong for vocabulary and habits, weak for real conversation
* **Tandem / HelloTalk** — supports conversation but lacks structure and safety
* **Discord language servers** — flexible but overwhelming and inconsistent

**Gap identified:** a lack of structured, psychologically safe environments for speaking-first practice.

---

## Product Strategy

Based on interviews and observation, we defined core **Jobs-To-Be-Done**:

* Find appropriate conversation partners quickly
* Feel safe and confident speaking
* See visible progress over time

Feature prioritization followed a **must / should / could** framework grounded in user research.

---

## Design & Prototyping

The product was developed iteratively:

* **Low-fidelity sketches** to explore core interaction flows
* **Heuristic evaluation** using Nielsen’s principles
* **Medium-fidelity interactive prototype** refining usability, clarity, and feedback

Key product concepts included:

* Visible language skill levels
* Practice rooms organized by topic and proficiency
* AI-assisted conversation support
* Progress tracking and lightweight gamification

---

## User Testing & Validation

We planned and conducted usability testing with bilingual users using task-based evaluation and post-session interviews.

**Key outcomes:**

* ~83% average likelihood-to-return score
* Strong perceived value of the core concept
* Identified confusion points related to navigation, role clarity, and visual hierarchy

Insights were synthesized into clear product recommendations focused on simplification, trust, and guidance.

---

## Key Learnings

* Clarity and guidance outperform feature depth
* Emotional safety is a first-order product constraint in social learning tools
* User behavior often diverges from design intent without continuous validation

---

## Future Work

* Simplify primary flows and reduce cognitive load
* Improve role clarity within conversation rooms
* Expand progress feedback and cultural learning elements
* Conduct broader usability testing with more diverse users

---

## Artifacts

* Presentation slides
* Research and evaluation reports
* Wireframes and interactive prototype (Figma)
